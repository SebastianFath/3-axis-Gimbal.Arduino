# 3-axis-Gimbal.Arduino
Software for a 2-IMU, 3-Axis Gimbal for Arduino microcontroller

The goal of the project is to create a so-called "3-axis-Gimbal".
A 3-axis-Gimbal is a Stabilizer for cameras, similar to a Flycam but utilizes Motors to compensate
different Movements that afflict the moviepicture of the camera.

The Software Part, we decided to use Arduino 101 needs to realize, which way the Gimbal needs to Compensate
and communicate this to the 3 Motors that controll the axes.
